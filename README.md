## GETTING THE CODE

The more complicated and easier to update method is using git. You'll need to download/setup git or some other client. When installed, open a terminal and visit the directory where you unzipped the source code and type in:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/alaa-shahin/chat.git
```
